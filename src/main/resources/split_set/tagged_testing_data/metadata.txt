source:
P3 LED experiments, 4 subjects, 3 stimuli (target - a green diode, non-target - a red diode, distractor - a yellow diode),
only targets and non-targets were extracted

raw_epochs_*.txt:
- number of rows = number of extracted epochs (678)
- epochs = no pre-processing, 1 kHz sampling, containing 1024 samples (24 pre-stimulus, 1000 post-stimulus)

targets.txt
= expected classes related to the epochs in the rows of raw_epochs_*.txt
- 0 - non-target
- 1 - target
